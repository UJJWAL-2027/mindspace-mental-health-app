# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account
2. Click the green "New" button to create a new repository
3. Fill in the details:
   - Repository name: `mindspace-mental-health-app`
   - Description: `A simple mental health journal and chatbot app built with React and Node.js`
   - Make it Public (recommended for open source)
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

Since your project is already initialized with Git, you need to:

1. **Download your project files:**
   - Go to the three dots menu in Replit
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the files to your local computer

2. **Open terminal/command prompt** on your local computer and navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/extracted/folder
   ```

3. **Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mindspace-mental-health-app.git
   ```
   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

4. **Add all files to git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Create your first commit:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: MindSpace mental health journal app"
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect it as a Vite project
6. Click "Deploy"

Your app will be live at a URL like: `https://mindspace-mental-health-app.vercel.app`

## Step 4: Deploy to Netlify (Alternative)

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose GitHub and select your repository
5. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

## Important Notes

- Your app uses in-memory storage, so data will reset on each deployment
- For production use, consider adding MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage
- The AI chatbot uses rule-based responses, so no API keys are required
- Make sure to add environment variables if you add external services later

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your local machine
2. Run `npm install` in your project directory
3. Test locally with `npm run dev` before deploying
4. Check that all files are included in your git repository

## Next Steps

Once deployed, you can:
- Share the live URL with others
- Continue development by making changes and pushing to GitHub
- Set up automatic deployments when you push new code
- Add more features and improvements

Your mental health journal app is now ready for the world!

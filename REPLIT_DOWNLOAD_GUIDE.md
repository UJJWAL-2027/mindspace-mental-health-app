# How to Download Your Project from Replit

## Method 1: Main Menu (Most Common)

**Look for these locations:**

1. **Top-right corner of Replit:**
   - Look for three dots (...) or hamburger menu (â‰¡)
   - Usually next to your profile picture/avatar
   - Click it and look for "Download as ZIP" or "Export"

2. **Project name dropdown:**
   - Click on your project name at the very top
   - Look for "Download" or "Export" option

3. **File menu:**
   - Look for a "File" menu in the top menu bar
   - Check for "Download project" or "Export"

## Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut

Try pressing: **Ctrl+Shift+D** (or **Cmd+Shift+D** on Mac)

## Method 3: URL Method

1. Go to your project URL
2. Add `/zip` to the end of the URL
3. Example: `https://replit.com/@yourusername/yourproject/zip`
4. This should trigger a download

## Method 4: Shell Command (Backup Method)

If none of the above work, use the Shell:

1. Click on the "Shell" tab (usually at the bottom)
2. Run this command:
```bash
zip -r my-project.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*" "__pycache__/*"
```
3. This creates a zip file in your project
4. You can then download individual files

## Method 5: Individual File Download

As a last resort:
1. Right-click on individual files in the file explorer
2. Select "Download" for each important file
3. This is tedious but works for key files

## What to Look For

The download option might be labeled as:
- "Download as ZIP"
- "Export project"
- "Download project"
- "Export as ZIP"
- Just "Download"

## If You Still Can't Find It

If none of these work, you have alternatives:
1. Make your Replit project public and share the link
2. Copy and paste your code files manually
3. Use GitHub's web interface to upload files directly
4. Contact Replit support for help

Try these methods in order - the first one usually works for most users!
